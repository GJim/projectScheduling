# projectScheduling
Use a genetic algorithm to arrange final project schedule

## Story
Actually, the project is making for myself, not for office assistant or office part-time.
The story started last year, I was a office part-time and I had a experiance of developing information booking system.
One day, office assistant asked me for scheduling the final project, it's really really time-consuming, it cost me all of the time during working hours.
I was frustrated because I can't try to fish in troubled waters.
After work, office assistant asked me a question "Can you making a system for doing this task?", I say "no" immediately, "computer is stupid, it can follow some basic regulation only, this task is too complicated to it".
Today, I want to tell my past, the stupid one is me, I take a narrow perspective on this problem, so I can't solve the problem then.
OK. The story is over, let's start to make the system.
